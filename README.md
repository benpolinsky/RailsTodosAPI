## Add Request Throttler/Blocker

### Track incoming requests

Allow a maximum of 3 requests per second, per user
Allow a maximum of ** write requests per minute, per user
Allow a maximum of ** read requests per minute, per user

Start at 5:50

UserRequest

- belongs_to user
- action - integer / enum
- created_at will be fine for the date field

=== if time get to below

ApiTier

For now, hard code the ApiTier to initial specs,
but add as model if time.

- name/label
- has_many ThrottleRules

ThrottleRule

- applies_to: int/enum (read / write / all)
- belongs_to ApiTier
- max_number_of_requests
- seconds_per_session (better name than session would be great)

ApiRequestThrottler - PORO which handles the inteaction
